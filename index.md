## About Me

I'm Xingyu Li (李星宇) from China, and I'm currently focusing on UAVs, autonomous vehicles, machine learning, and lightweight mapping based on ML. 
<span style="color: #1976d2;">I am applying for a Ph.D. program for Fall 2026.</span>

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning for Robotics:** ML-based mapping, optimization frameworks, large-scale environment perception
- **Mapping and Localization:** Real-time occupancy grid mapping, lightweight mapping algorithms, perception-aware trajectory planning
- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems:** Autonomous flight planning, multi-UAV cooperative systems, autonomous vehicle systems
